# Decentralized Identity and Credential Verification System

A blockchain-powered platform for secure, privacy-preserving digital identity and credential management.

## Core Components

### Identity Management
- Sovereign digital identity creation
- Decentralized credential issuance
- Privacy-first verification protocols
- Zero-knowledge proof integration

### Verification Mechanisms
- Cryptographically secured credentials
- Instant verification capabilities
- Revocation and expiration tracking
- Cross-institutional recognition

### System Requirements
- Blockchain infrastructure
- Cryptographic key management
- Secure storage solutions
- Inter-institutional API integrations

### Installation
```bash
npm install decentralized-identity
pip install zkp-verification
docker-compose up identity-network
```

## Operational Parameters

### Verification Configuration
```python
# Core Identity Management Settings
PROOF_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.99
CREDENTIAL_EXPIRATION_PERIOD = 365  # Days
MAX_VERIFICATION_RESPONSE_TIME = 5  # Seconds
REVOCATION_GRACE_PERIOD = 30  # Days
```

### Key Features
- Cryptographically secure identity creation
- Privacy-preserving verification
- Instant credential validation
- Tamper-evident credential storage

## Zero-Knowledge Proof Mechanisms

### Verification Process
1. Credential issuer generates proof
2. Cryptographic signature created
3. Minimal personal information exposed
4. Instant verification without full data reveal
5. Maintaining individual privacy

## Security Protocols
